LONG TERM
- Bundle everything together into the same package, allowing for it to be run on both hpc and laptops and for repeated bombardments and multi bombards
- Get it on git and using version control
- Working on both DIRAC and Blue crystal
- sort out file naming and structure for multi bombard
-progress bar not working for bc4, move log file immediately so need to look

SHORT TERM

- does it work with other features such as (111) diamond or graphite layers
- Auto adjust atom producing region
- Calculate ion flux in analysis (maybe have this as an input? Would need time period as well)
- For a true comparison need to use the same random seeds?

- Calculate surface, after equilibrating run, average out top however many atoms in the top layer (might actually be bottom layer,
